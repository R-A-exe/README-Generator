The purpose of this tool is to provide an easy and convenient way of creating a README file. The tool prompts users to choose from a list of titles they would like to include. Available options are:

- Description
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Tests
- Questions
- Custom section

The first 7 are selected by default. Follow the selection, users are prompted to provide the content of each section.

For License, a list of options are available to choose from.

For Custom sections, users are prompted to type the title then its content, then whether they wish to add a new custom section, which would repeat the prompts.

When complete, the tool will generate the README file within its directory.

## Installation

After downloading the files into a local directory, users must navigate to said directory in terminal, and install all project dependencies by running
```md
npm install
```
No further steps are required for installation.




## Usage

To use the tool, users must navigate to its directory in terminal, and run the index.js file on node:
```md
node index.js
```
When the program launches, users would follow the prompts. Most fields must be completed in an editor, for which the tool will default to the users' terminal editor. The input will be registered as soon as users save and exit the editor.

The other types of input are checkbox lists for the selection of titles, a choice list for the selection of License, and regular input for 1 line entries.

When the last prompt is answered, the tool will generate the README in its directory. It will be titled by the name users provide, and a table of content will include the titles users chose. Further editing can be done manually.
